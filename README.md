# The "Simon" Memory game
This project is based on the memory game "Simon" invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates,
with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence

## UX
The user interface for this project will remain as clear and simple as possible as the focus of the project is making the game work in the back end
whiles making sure that thw front end of the project remains interactive. The UX will utilise HTML and CSS with heavy use of the Bootstrap framework 
provided by the good people over at Twitter. 

## User Stories
"As someone who doesnt use computers very often I would like the game to be as simple as possible so I dont have to spend time figuring out how to play the game before I can dive in."

"Due to being color blind, I would like some extra features on the game so that I dont have to be relying soley on a colour based system for playing the game. Perhaps you could add
some lights or sounds to to the game. "

"Being a keen gamer and so competitively minded, I would like the game to tell me how Im doing on my current level and what the highest level that I have achieved in this current session is"


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Buttons
The game will consist of multiple buttons, there will a start button, a reset button and one button for each of the four colours. There may also be a button for turning on
and off the sound options on the colours.


## Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

## JQuery / Javascript
The project uses JQuery and Javascript for DOM manipulation.


## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Contact form:

Using EmailJS, I will set up a contact the developer option for reporting encountered bugs with the game

Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
(GITHUB PAGES) This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
